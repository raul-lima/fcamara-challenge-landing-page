## About

This project is a landing page designed and developed to inform a company's (Fcamara) employees about the return to the presential work stations.
These are the informations the company wanted to give its employees through the landing page:

* There are two offices to choose from: one located at SÃ£o Paulo and another at Santos.
* The offices stay open from 8am to 6pm.
* The offices are gonna be limited to 40% of the employees, according to legislation.
* The page needs to let the employees choose the office, the working station by number and the day they're gonna go back to presential work.
* Employees are gonna get their temperatures tested at the door.
* Employees must wear a mask inside the office.
* Employees must seat on their designated tables, which are marked by stickers.
* Employees with any symptons must stay home.
* Returning to presential work is optional. Employees can choose to stay working from home.
